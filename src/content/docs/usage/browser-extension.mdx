Granted can integrate with your web browser using the [Granted Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/granted/cjjieeldgoohbkifkogalkmfpddeafcm) and the [Granted Firefox Add-On](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/granted/). These extensions provide security and usability improvements when working with AWS. The Granted Chrome Extension works with all Chromium-based browsers, such as Arc, Microsoft Edge, and Vivaldi.

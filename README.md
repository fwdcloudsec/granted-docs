# docs

Source code for https://docs.granted.dev.

## Contributing

Our documentation website uses the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) framework. You can run the documentation site locally in order to preview your changes.

To do this, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [git LFS](https://git-lfs.com)

Git LFS is used for image storage. Ensure that you've followed the [Git LFS getting started guide](https://git-lfs.com) prior to contributing to the repository.

Install dependencies by running:

```
pnpm install
```

Then, start a local development server by running:

```
pnpm run dev
```

The docs website will be available on http://localhost:4321 by default.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
